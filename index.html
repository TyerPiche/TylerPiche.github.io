    <h3 class="feature"> Support for Urkraine</h3>
<p>My page has been edited to show support for Ukraine: "Globally, awareness of the association between sunflowers and Ukraine has grown since Feb. 24, the first day of the invasion, when the news outlet Ukraine World shared a video on Twitter showing a Ukrainian woman in Henychesk giving sunflower seeds to Russian soldiers, with the striking instruction to put the seeds in their pockets so the flowers will grow where they die. The video has racked up 8.6 million views on Twitter since it was uploaded on Feb. 24.
</p>

<p>But the flower has an even longer history in the country. Sunflowers-soniashnyk in Ukrainian—have been grown in Ukraine since the mid-18th century, according to a 1993 Encyclopedia of Ukraine. At the time of the book's publication, sunflower seeds were the country's most popular snack. The flower also helps fuel the national economy today; Ukraine and Russia supply up to 70-80% of the world's sunflower oil exports."</p>
